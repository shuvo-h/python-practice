"""
JWTAuthentication class in Django REST Framework (DRF) looks for the access token in the Authorization header by default.
Since the token is being stored in a cookie, DRF cannot find the token where it expects, leading to the error youâ€™re seeing.

You need to modify the JWTAuthentication class or write a custom middleware to read the access token from the cookie rather than from the Authorization header.
